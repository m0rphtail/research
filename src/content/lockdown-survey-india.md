### Introduction

COVID-19 surged exponentially with numbers hitting hundreds of thousands in May of 2021 in India, yet we assess that the actual data may not be reported accurately. As predicted by global policymakers, this 2nd wave took a disastrous shape and what needs to be seen is how we face an incoming third wave.
Muellners Foundation set up a team to observe the countrywide policies implemented by the government. Our report observes Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Orissa, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. Our report follows local regulations and civic bodies working on the healthcare front. We support our research and findings with experimental methods, including conducting surveys by directly asking questions, recording information, corroborating with local media, and correlating with data. Although, we do not claim that the study in its entirety can be used for specific and directed policy making, we have provided our best effort here to present unbiased and factual information.

The purpose of this report is to set recommendations for ongoing efforts in resource management and to provide visibility to donors. We anticipate this crisis will be here for several years. The long-lasting impact of this is quite visible in economic conditions and government policymaking . Government favouring  non-scientific methods, irregular non informed top down decision making is costing lives.

On May 2, as part of Muellners Foundation, we set out on the road to assess the implementation of the lockdown measures and understand the on-ground truth across various communities and agencies dealing with the bulk of the rising cases.

There was a mass shutdown of services, and many daily wage labourers and similar income communities bore no work. Yes, no livelihood! Specific well-to-do neighbourhoods have set up food kitchens to help alleviate hunger across states visited.

Many NGO’s and other organizations have reached out a helping hand to those in need. Several restaurants serve people food , free of charge,  but only a limited amount. There is some government support in the form of monthly rations disbursed and allocated via local ration shops.
People en masse have been moving back to their hometowns and villages due to a lack of available work and sustainable income. Food scarcity remains one of the more significant issues to tackle nationally.

In Chennai, large swathes of migrant labourers were seen in clusters on the outskirts and inside the city. Here, we met with  Meals for Madras, a digital food aid program in its nascent stages, whose goal is to deliver meals to needy communities.

The size of the migrant labourer population in Chennai appears to exceed the magnitude of the current efforts to address the food and daily needs shortage. Some populations of migrants have faced the impending depletion of their food reserves, basically completely running out.
In places we visited, lockdown measures  have been enforced to a larger degree than in rural areas where people are showing some signs of a torpid attitude to the restrictions.

Marginalized communities and people with no homes appear to be receiving some assistance from local communities. In several small town’s the local communities support each other by distributing food one such example is Aggrawal, community of business owners in Odisha. India is a land of spirituality and a land of goodwill.

Across the extensive network of villages between the Tier I, II-III cities, the shortage of economic avenues was already beginning to appear . Quite a few village shops were semi-shuttered. Restaurants had no or little business and were hard hit. Even as the communities came together to support each other, fear, widespread dread and anxiety were prevalent almost everywhere we visited.

Urban and rural Police alike were found to subjectively enforce rules. The enforcement of regulations and the government directives themselves were quite unclear to the departments, and therefore, there were at times  a state of confused and improper implementations.

The Police force implemented many checkpoints throughout the significant entry and exit points at state borders, but these points did not have adequate screening measures. There were no containment areas or detainment zones alongside. In some places, the irregularities in enforcement were observed as the state police had their own set of directives bypassing  the federal government’s directives.

There were some obstacles faced by poor migrant populations in terms of detaining individuals and conducting covid RAT (Rapid Assessment Tests); however, the tests were performed with elevated pricing that was pushed onto people.  And resultantly the government provided  supply was redirected onto people who were being detained and charged for the increased cost.

Lockdown has a widespread traumatic impact but too much movement can lead to viral infections across different communities.  In this second wave of the virus, the federal government has left lockdown decisions and enforcement to individual states and as a result each state has differing policies, which has led   to confusion and chaos.

Outer parts of the cities and rural areas are found to be more relaxed in following covid rules and also have limited awareness of the rules and medical information. It is quite clear population density helps for enforcement, but how do you cover large rural areas with poor infrastructure . In some rural communities, a single person is administering tests for more than 100 people.

Our story is the on the ground coverage of various real stories and situations. This is going to be a three part series of a research paper covering mental, economic and  societal conditions to help inform open ended discussion for policy makers.
